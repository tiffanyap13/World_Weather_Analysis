# World_Weather_Analysis
The following deliverables will be submitted to assist Beta testers with the PlanMyTrip app:

 - Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
    -  A set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes was generated, the nearest city was retrieved, and an API call was made with the OpenWeatherMap.  A new DataFrame was created which contains the updated weather data.
 - Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
   -  Input statements were used to retrieve customer weather preferences, which were in turn used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. These are shown on a marker layer map with pop-up markers.
 - Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
   -  Using Google Directions API, a travel itinerary was created to show the route between four cities chosen from possible travel destinations.  A marker layer map with pop-up markers reflects this sample Australian travel itinerary.
